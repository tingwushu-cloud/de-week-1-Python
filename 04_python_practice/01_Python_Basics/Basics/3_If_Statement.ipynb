    "The simplest way to control the flow of your Python program is with an `if` statement. From a high level, an `if` statement allows us to check whether or not a certain condition is true. If it is, certain operations will be performed. Otherwise, those operations will not be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we're asked to write a program that takes a bunch of numbers and gives back to us those that are even. We would need to write an `if` statement that identifies whether or not a number is even (we'll talk later about how to do this), and then give back only those that meet the even condition. This is a program that will be entirely within our ability to implement at the end of next week; for now, though, let's focus on the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax of an `if` statement in Python is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    if_block_statement\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the `if` statement, after the condition, ends in a colon `:`. This is the way that Python declares the start of an indentation block. The purposes of indentation blocks manifest themselves in many different ways. With our `if` statement, just know that they mark a section of code that is run under specific circumstances, when the condition is true. What does it mean, then, for a condition to be true? To understand this, let's look at conditionals."

    "Let's tackle this one part at a time. What does it mean to be a condition? Really, all an `if` is checking is whether the conditional evaluates to `True` or `False`. In english, it checks if the condition is true or not. If the condition is true, then the body of the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is false, the `if` block is skipped. Intuitively, true and false are concepts that make perfect sense to us. But, we should take the time to clearly define them in a programming context.\n",

    "`True` and `False` are what we call booleans in logic, and what Python calls them (`bool` for short). They are a special variable type with many potential uses; mainly they are used as a way to put a label on the truth of a statement. There are two specifically reserved words for booleans in Python, `True` and `False`. Note that these begin with capital letters."
